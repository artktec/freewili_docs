TwiML `<Play>`
===================

The `<Play>` verb plays an audio file back to the caller. Freewili retrieves the file from a URL that you provide.

Hints and Advanced Uses
-----------------------
Freewili will attempt to cache the audio file the first time it is played.

This means the first attempt may be slow to play due to the time spent downloading the file from your remote server. Freewili may play a processing sound while the file is being downloaded.

Freewili obeys standard HTTP caching headers. If you change a file already cached by Freewili, make sure your web server is sending the proper headers to inform us that the contents of the file have changed.

Audio played over the telephone network is transcoded to a format the telephone network understands. Regardless of the quality of the file you provide us, we will transcode so it plays correctly. This may result in lower quality because the telephone number does not support high bitrate audio.

High bitrate, lossy encoded files, such as 128kbps mp3 files, will take longer to transcode and potentially sound worse than files that are in lossless 8kbps formats. This is due to the inevitable degradation that occurs when converting from lossy compressed formats and the processing involved in converting from higher bit rates to low bit rates.
