How it works
================

Hooking up a DID
-----------------
First have your own DID provider. Some providers that we have tested are:

    * Vitelity
    
Add all of the SIP gateway data to your Freewili account. When making calls we will use this SIP gateway.


Hooking up A Number
-------------------
Having a Number call into Freewili is a process that needs to happen with your DID provider. Just add SIP forwarding to the phone number of your choice. Forward the number to sip.freewili.com or the IP address 75.101.139.0
